**FilmSphere Relational Database**
This repository contains the design and implementation of a relational database for FilmSphere, a fictional online movie streaming platform. The project was developed as part of the "Databases" course in the Computer Engineering Bachelor's Degree program.​

## Overview
The objective of this project is to model and implement a relational database that supports the core functionalities of a movie streaming service. These functionalities include user management, movie cataloging, subscription handling, and analytics.​

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:​

ER.pdf: Entity-Relationship diagram illustrating the conceptual schema of the database.​
GitHub

Tabelle.sql: SQL script for creating the database tables.​

Vincoli.sql: SQL script defining the integrity constraints.​

Popolamento.sql: SQL script for populating the database with sample data.​

Operazioni.sql: SQL script containing various operations to interact with the database.​

Analytics.sql: SQL script for performing analytical queries on the data.​

Test.sql: SQL script for testing the database functionalities.​

Documentazione.pdf: Comprehensive documentation detailing the design choices, schema descriptions, and implementation details.​

Progetto A.A.22-23.pdf: Project specifications provided for the academic year 2022-2023.​

## Getting Started
To set up and explore the database:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have a MySQL database server installed.​

Database Creation:

Execute Tabelle.sql to create the necessary tables.​

Run Vincoli.sql to apply integrity constraints.

Use Popolamento.sql to insert sample data into the database.​

## Operations and Testing:

Perform various operations using Operazioni.sql.​

Conduct analytical queries with Analytics.sql.​

Validate functionalities using Test.sql.​
