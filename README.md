# FilmSphere Relational Database

This repository contains the design and implementation of a relational database for **FilmSphere**, a fictional online movie streaming platform.  
The project was developed as part of the *Databases* course in the Computer Engineering Bachelor's Degree program.

## üìö Overview

The goal of this project is to model and implement a relational database that supports the core functionalities of a movie streaming service.  
These functionalities include user management, movie cataloging, subscription handling, and analytics.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- **`ER.pdf`**: Entity-Relationship diagram illustrating the conceptual schema of the database.
- **`Tabelle.sql`**: SQL script for creating the database tables.
- **`Vincoli.sql`**: SQL script defining the integrity constraints.
- **`Popolamento.sql`**: SQL script for populating the database with sample data.
- **`Operazioni.sql`**: SQL script containing various operations to interact with the database.
- **`Analytics.sql`**: SQL script for performing analytical queries on the data.
- **`Test.sql`**: SQL script for testing the database functionalities.
- **`Documentazione.pdf`**: Documentation detailing the design choices, schema descriptions, and implementation details.
- **`Progetto A.A.22-23.pdf`**: Project specifications provided for the academic year 2022‚Äì2023.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up and explore the database on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- MySQL server or compatible relational database system

### Setup Steps

1. Execute `Tabelle.sql` to create the database tables.
2. Run `Vincoli.sql` to apply integrity constraints.
3. Execute `Popolamento.sql` to insert sample data into the tables.

### Usage

- Run `Operazioni.sql` to perform basic operations (e.g., inserts, updates).
- Use `Analytics.sql` to perform analytical queries and reports.
- Run `Test.sql` to verify the correctness of the database and queries.
